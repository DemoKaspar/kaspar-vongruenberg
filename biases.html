        <main>
            <p>I run and have founded companies in the Platform Engineering ecosystem. This creates perspective, incentives, and constraints.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Work</h2>
            <p>When writing theoretical work, on this site, in the book, or in essays, I aim to reason independently of any specific vendor, including those I am involved with. Arguments should stand even if none of my companies existed.</p>

            <h2>Commercial Interests</h2>
            <p>When discussing work related to organizations I run or founded, I state this explicitly.</p>

            <p>The newsletter does not accept sponsors, paid placements, or "pay-to-play" contributions. If commercial interests are relevant to a topic, they are disclosed.</p>

            <h2>Standards</h2>
            <p>Complete neutrality is neither possible nor claimed. Intellectual honesty and transparency are the standards I hold myself accountable for. Should you feel I violate them, please tell me.</p>
